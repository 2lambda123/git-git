BUT v1.5.0.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.0
------------------

* Documentation updates

  - Clarifications and corrections to 1.5.0 release notes.

  - The main documentation did not link to but-remote documentation.

  - Clarified introductory text of but-rebase documentation.

  - Converted remaining mentions of update-index on Porcelain
    documents to but-add/but-rm.

  - Some i18n.* configuration variables were incorrectly
    described as core.*; fixed.

* Bugfixes

  - but-add and but-update-index on a filesystem on which
    executable bits are unreliable incorrectly reused st_mode
    bits even when the path changed between symlink and regular
    file.

  - but-daemon marks the listening sockets with FD_CLOEXEC so
    that it won't be leaked into the children.

  - segfault from but-blame when the mandatory pathname
    parameter was missing was fixed; usage() message is given
    instead.

  - but-rev-list did not read $BUT_DIR/config file, which means
    that did not honor i18n.logoutputencoding correctly.

* Tweaks

  - sliding mmap() inefficiently mmaped the same region of a
    packfile with an access pattern that used objects in the
    reverse order.  This has been made more efficient.
