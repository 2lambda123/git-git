BUT v1.5.0.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.0.3
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - but-merge (hence but-pull) did not refuse fast-forwarding
    when the working tree had local changes that would have
    conflicted with it.

  - but.el does not add duplicate sign-off lines.

  - but-cummit shows the full stat of the resulting cummit, not
    just about the files in the current directory, when run from
    a subdirectory.

  - "but-checkout -m '@{8 hours ago}'" had a funny failure from
    eval; fixed.

  - but-gui updates.

* Documentation updates

* User manual updates
