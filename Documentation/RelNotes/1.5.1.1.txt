BUT v1.5.1.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.1
------------------

* Documentation updates

  - The --left-right option of rev-list and friends is documented.

  - The documentation for cvsimport has been majorly improved.

  - "but-show-ref --exclude-existing" was documented.

* Bugfixes

  - The implementation of -p option in "but cvsexportcummit" had
    the meaning of -C (context reduction) option wrong, and
    loosened the context requirements when it was told to be
    strict.

  - "but cvsserver" did not behave like the real cvsserver when
    client side removed a file from the working tree without
    doing anything else on the path.  In such a case, it should
    restore it from the checked out revision.

  - "but fsck" issued an alarming error message on detached
    HEAD.  It is not an error since at least 1.5.0.

  - "but send-email" produced of References header of unbounded length;
    fixed this with line-folding.

  - "but archive" to download from remote site should not
    require you to be in a but repository, but it incorrectly
    did.

  - "but apply" ignored -p<n> for "diff --but" formatted
    patches.

  - "but rerere" recorded a conflict that had one side empty
    (the other side adds) incorrectly; this made merging in the
    other direction fail to use previously recorded resolution.

  - t4200 test was broken where "wc -l" pads its output with
    spaces.

  - "but branch -m old new" to rename branch did not work
    without a configuration file in ".but/config".

  - The sample hook for notification e-mail was misnamed.

  - butweb did not show type-changing patch correctly in the
    blobdiff view.

  - but-svn did not error out with incorrect command line options.

  - but-svn fell into an infinite loop when insanely long cummit
    message was found.

  - but-svn dcummit and rebase was confused by patches that were
    merged from another branch that is managed by but-svn.

  - but-svn used to get confused when globbing remote branch/tag
    spec (e.g. "branches = proj/branches/*:refs/remotes/origin/*")
    is used and there was a plain file that matched the glob.
