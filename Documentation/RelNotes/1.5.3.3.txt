--------------------

 * but-quiltimport did not like it when a patch described in the
   series file does not exist.

   explicitly asked not to.

 * sample post-receive hook overquoted the envelope sender
   value.

 * but-am got confused when the patch contained a change that is
   only about type and not contents.

   unnecessarily.
