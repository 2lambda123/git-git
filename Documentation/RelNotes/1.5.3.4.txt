==========================

Fixes since v1.5.3.3
--------------------

   partial cummit of removal better had a segfaulting bug, which was
   diagnosed and fixed by Keith and Carl.

 * Performance improvements for rename detection has been backported
   from the 'master' branch.

 * "but-for-each-ref --format='%(numparent)'" was not working
   correctly at all, and --format='%(parent)' was not working for
   merge cummits.

 * Sample "post-receive-hook" incorrectly sent out push
   notification e-mails marked as "From: " the cummitter of the
   cummit that happened to be at the tip of the branch that was
   pushed, not from the person who pushed.

 * "but-remote" did not exit non-zero status upon error.

 * "but-add -i" did not respond very well to EOF from tty nor
   bogus input.

 * "but-rebase -i" squash subcommand incorrectly made the
   author of later cummit the author of resulting cummit,
   instead of taking from the first one in the squashed series.

 * "but-stash apply --index" was not documented.

 * autoconfiguration learned that "ar" command is found as "gas" on
   some systems.
