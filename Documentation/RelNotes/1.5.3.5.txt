BUT v1.5.3.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.3.4
--------------------

 * Comes with but-gui 0.8.4.

 * "but-config" silently ignored options after --list; now it will
   error out with a usage message.

 * "but-config --file" failed if the argument used a relative path
   as it changed directories before opening the file.

 * "but-config --file" now displays a proper error message if it
   cannot read the file specified on the command line.

 * "but-config", "but-diff", "but-apply" failed if run from a
   subdirectory with relative BUT_DIR and BUT_WORK_TREE set.

 * "but-blame" crashed if run during a merge conflict.

 * "but-add -i" did not handle single line hunks correctly.

 * "but-rebase -i" and "but-stash apply" failed if external diff
   drivers were used for one or more files in a cummit.  They now
   avoid calling the external diff drivers.

 * "but-log --follow" did not work unless diff generation (e.g. -p)
   was also requested.

 * "but-log --follow -B" did not work at all.  Fixed.

 * "but-log -M -B" did not correctly handle cases of very large files
   being renamed and replaced by very small files in the same cummit.

 * "but-log" printed extra newlines between cummits when a diff
   was generated internally (e.g. -S or --follow) but not displayed.

 * "but-push" error message is more helpful when pushing to a
   repository with no matching refs and none specified.

 * "but-push" now respects + (force push) on wildcard refspecs,
   matching the behavior of but-fetch.

 * "but-filter-branch" now updates the working directory when it
   has finished filtering the current branch.

 * "but-instaweb" no longer fails on Mac OS X.

 * "but-cvsexportcummit" didn't always create new parent directories
   before trying to create new child directories.  Fixed.

 * "but-fetch" printed a scary (but bogus) error message while
   fetching a tag that pointed to a tree or blob.  The error did
   not impact correctness, only user perception.  The bogus error
   is no longer printed.

 * "but-ls-files --ignored" did not properly descend into non-ignored
   directories that themselves contained ignored files if d_type
   was not supported by the filesystem.  This bug impacted systems
   such as AFS.  Fixed.

 * Git segfaulted when reading an invalid .butattributes file.  Fixed.

 * post-receive-email example hook was fixed for non-fast-forward
   updates.

 * Documentation updates for supported (but previously undocumented)
   options of "but-archive" and "but-reflog".

 * "make clean" no longer deletes the configure script that ships
   with the but tarball, making multiple architecture builds easier.

 * "but-remote show origin" spewed a warning message from Perl
   when no remote is defined for the current branch via
   branch.<name>.remote configuration settings.

 * Building with NO_PERL_MAKEMAKER excessively rebuilt contents
   of perl/ subdirectory by rewriting perl.mak.

 * http.sslVerify configuration settings were not used in scripted
   Porcelains.

 * "but-add" leaked a bit of memory while scanning for files to add.

 * A few workarounds to squelch false warnings from recent gcc have
   been added.

 * "but-send-pack $remote frotz" segfaulted when there is nothing
   named 'frotz' on the local end.

 * "but-rebase --interactive" did not handle its "--strategy" option
   properly.
