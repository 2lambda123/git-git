BUT v1.5.4.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.4.2
--------------------

 * RPM spec used to pull in everything with 'but'.  This has been
   changed so that 'but' package contains just the core parts,
   and we now supply 'but-all' metapackage to slurp in everything.
   This should match end user's expectation better.

 * When some refs failed to update, but-push reported "failure"
   which was unclear if some other refs were updated or all of
   them failed atomically (the answer is the former).  Reworded
   the message to clarify this.

 * "but clone" from a repository whose HEAD was misconfigured
   did not set up the remote properly.  Now it tries to do
   better.

 * Updated but-push documentation to clarify what "matching"
   means, in order to reduce user confusion.

 * Updated but-add documentation to clarify "add -u" operates in
   the current subdirectory you are in, just like other commands.

 * but-gui updates to work on OSX and Windows better.
