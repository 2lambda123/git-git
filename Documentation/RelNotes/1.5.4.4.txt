BUT v1.5.4.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.4.3
--------------------

 * Building and installing with an overtight umask such as 077 made
   installed templates unreadable by others, while the rest of the install
   are done in a way that is friendly to umask 022.

 * "but cvsexportcummit -w $cvsdir" misbehaved when BUT_DIR is set to a
   relative directory.

 * "but http-push" had an invalid memory access that could lead it to
   segfault.

 * When "but rebase -i" gave control back to the user for a cummit that is
   marked to be edited, it just said "modify it with cummit --amend",
   without saying what to do to continue after modifying it.  Give an
   explicit instruction to run "rebase --continue" to be more helpful.

 * "but send-email" in 1.5.4.3 issued a bogus empty In-Reply-To: header.

 * "but bisect" showed mysterious "won't bisect on seeked tree" error message.
   This was leftover from Cobuto days to prevent "bisect" starting from a
   cg-seeked state.  We still keep the Cobuto safety, but running "but bisect
   start" when another bisect was in effect will clean up and start over.

 * "but push" with an explicit PATH to receive-pack did not quite work if
   receive-pack was not on usual PATH.  We earlier fixed the same issue
   with "but fetch" and upload-pack, but somehow forgot to do so in the
   other direction.

 * but-gui's info dialog was not displayed correctly when the user tries
   to cummit nothing (i.e. without staging anything).

 * "but revert" did not properly fail when attempting to run with a
   dirty index.

 * "but merge --no-cummit --no-ff <other>" incorrectly made cummits.

 * "but merge --squash --no-ff <other>", which is a nonsense combination
   of options, was not rejected.

 * "but ls-remote" and "but remote show" against an empty repository
   failed, instead of just giving an empty result (regression).

 * "but fast-import" did not handle a renamed path whose name needs to be
   quoted, due to a bug in unquote_c_style() function.

 * "but cvsexportcummit" was confused when multiple files with the same
   basename needed to be pushed out in the same cummit.

 * "but daemon" did not send early errors to syslog.

 * "but log --merge" did not work well with --left-right option.

 * "but svn" prompted for client cert password every time it accessed the
   server.

 * The reset command in "but fast-import" data stream was documented to
   end with an optional LF, but it actually required one.

 * "but svn dcummit/rebase" did not honor --rewrite-root option.

Also included are a handful documentation updates.
