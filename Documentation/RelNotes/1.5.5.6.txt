BUT v1.5.5.6 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since 1.5.5.5
-------------------

 * Removed support for an obsolete butweb request URI, whose
   implementation ran "but diff" Porcelain, instead of using plumbing,
   which would have run an external diff command specified in the
   repository configuration as the butweb user.
