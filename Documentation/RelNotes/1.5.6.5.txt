BUT v1.5.6.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.6.4
--------------------

* "but cvsimport" used to spit out "UNKNOWN LINE..." diagnostics to stdout.

* "but cummit -F filename" and "but tag -F filename" run from subdirectories
  did not read the right file.

* "but init --template=" with blank "template" parameter linked files
  under root directories to .but, which was a total nonsense.  Instead, it
  means "I do not want to use anything from the template directory".

* "but diff-tree" and other diff plumbing ignored diff.renamelimit configuration
  variable when the user explicitly asked for rename detection.

* "but name-rev --name-only" did not work when "--stdin" option was in effect.

* "but show-branch" mishandled its 8th branch.

* Addition of "but update-index --ignore-submodules" that happened during
  1.5.6 cycle broke "but update-index --ignore-missing".

* "but send-email" did not parse charset from an existing Content-type:
  header properly.

Contains other various documentation fixes.
