GIT v1.6.0.6 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since 1.6.0.5
-------------------

 * "but fsck" had a deep recursion that wasted stack space.

 * "but fast-export" and "but fast-import" choked on an old style
   annotated tag that lack the tagger information.

 * "but mergetool -- file" did not correctly skip "--" marker that
   signals the end of options list.

 * "but show $tag" segfaulted when an annotated $tag pointed at a
   nonexistent object.

 * "but show 2>error" when the standard output is automatically redirected
   to the pager redirected the standard error to the pager as well; there
   was no need to.

 * "but send-email" did not correctly handle list of addresses when
   they had quoted comma (e.g. "Lastname, Givenname" <mail@addre.ss>).

 * Logic to discover branch ancestry in "but svn" was unreliable when
   the process to fetch history was interrupted.

 * Removed support for an obsolete butweb request URI, whose
   implementation ran "but diff" Porcelain, instead of using plumbing,
   which would have run an external diff command specified in the
   repository configuration as the butweb user.

Also contains numerous documentation typofixes.
