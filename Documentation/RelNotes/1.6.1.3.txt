GIT v1.6.1.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.1.2
--------------------

* "but diff --binary | but apply" pipeline did not work well when
  a binary blob is changed to a symbolic link.

* Some combinations of -b/-w/--ignore-space-at-eol to "but diff" did
  not work as expected.

* "but grep" did not pass the -I (ignore binary) option when
  calling out an external grep program.

* "but log" and friends include HEAD to the set of starting points
  when --all is given.  This makes a difference when you are not
  on any branch.

* "but mv" to move an untracked file to overwrite a tracked
  contents misbehaved.

* "but merge -s octopus" with many potential merge bases did not
  work correctly.

* RPM binary package installed the html manpages in a wrong place.

Also includes minor documentation fixes and updates.
