BUT v1.6.1 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.6.0
--------------------

When some commands (e.g. "but log", "but diff") spawn pager internally, we
used to make the pager the parent process of the but command that produces
output.  This meant that the exit status of the whole thing comes from the
pager, not the underlying but command.  We swapped the order of the
processes around and you will see the exit code from the command from now
on.

(subsystems)

* butk can call out to but-gui to view "but blame" output; but-gui in turn
  can run butk from its blame view.

* Various but-gui updates including updated translations.

* Various butweb updates from repo.or.cz installation.

* Updates to emacs bindings.

(portability)

* A few test scripts used nonportable "grep" that did not work well on
  some platforms, e.g. Solaris.

* Sample pre-auto-gc script has OS X support.

* Makefile has support for (ancient) FreeBSD 4.9.

(performance)

* Many operations that are lstat(3) heavy can be told to pre-execute
  necessary lstat(3) in parallel before their main operations, which
  potentially gives much improved performance for cold-cache cases or in
  environments with weak metadata caching (e.g. NFS).

* The underlying diff machinery to produce textual output has been
  optimized, which would result in faster "but blame" processing.

* Most of the test scripts (but not the ones that try to run servers)
  can be run in parallel.

* Bash completion of refnames in a repository with massive number of
  refs has been optimized.

* Cygwin port uses native stat/lstat implementations when applicable,
  which leads to improved performance.

* "but push" pays attention to alternate repositories to avoid sending
  unnecessary objects.

* "but svn" can rebuild an out-of-date rev_map file.

(usability, bells and whistles)

* When you mistype a command name, but helpfully suggests what it guesses
  you might have meant to say.  help.autocorrect configuration can be set
  to a non-zero value to accept the suggestion when but can uniquely
  guess.

* The packfile machinery hopefully is more robust when dealing with
  corrupt packs if redundant objects involved in the corruption are
  available elsewhere.

* "but add -N path..." adds the named paths as an empty blob, so that
  subsequent "but diff" will show a diff as if they are creation events.

* "but add" gained a built-in synonym for people who want to say "stage
  changes" instead of "add contents to the staging area" which amounts
  to the same thing.

* "but apply" learned --include=paths option, similar to the existing
  --exclude=paths option.

* "but bisect" is careful about a user mistake and suggests testing of
  merge base first when good is not a strict ancestor of bad.

* "but bisect skip" can take a range of cummits.

* "but blame" re-encodes the cummit metainfo to UTF-8 from i18n.cummitEncoding
  by default.

* "but check-attr --stdin" can check attributes for multiple paths.

* "but checkout --track origin/hack" used to be a syntax error.  It now
  DWIMs to create a corresponding local branch "hack", i.e. acts as if you
  said "but checkout --track -b hack origin/hack".

* "but checkout --ours/--theirs" can be used to check out one side of a
  conflicting merge during conflict resolution.

* "but checkout -m" can be used to recreate the initial conflicted state
  during conflict resolution.

* "but cherry-pick" can also utilize rerere for conflict resolution.

* "but clone" learned to be verbose with -v

* "but cummit --author=$name" can look up author name from existing
  cummits.

* output from "but cummit" has been reworded in a more concise and yet
  more informative way.

* "but count-objects" reports the on-disk footprint for packfiles and
  their corresponding idx files.

* "but daemon" learned --max-connections=<count> option.

* "but daemon" exports REMOTE_ADDR to record client address, so that
  spawned programs can act differently on it.

* "but describe --tags" favours closer lightweight tags than farther
  annotated tags now.

* "but diff" learned to mimic --suppress-blank-empty from GNU diff via a
  configuration option.

* "but diff" learned to put more sensible hunk headers for Python,
  HTML and ObjC contents.

* "but diff" learned to vary the a/ vs b/ prefix depending on what are
  being compared, controlled by diff.mnemonicprefix configuration.

* "but diff" learned --dirstat-by-file to count changed files, not number
  of lines, when summarizing the global picture.

* "but diff" learned "textconv" filters --- a binary or hard-to-read
  contents can be munged into human readable form and the difference
  between the results of the conversion can be viewed (obviously this
  cannot produce a patch that can be applied, so this is disabled in
  format-patch among other things).

* "--cached" option to "but diff has an easier to remember synonym "--staged",
  to ask "what is the difference between the given cummit and the
  contents staged in the index?"

* "but for-each-ref" learned "refname:short" token that gives an
  unambiguously abbreviated refname.

* Auto-numbering of the subject lines is the default for "but
  format-patch" now.

* "but grep" learned to accept -z similar to GNU grep.

* "but help" learned to use BUT_MAN_VIEWER environment variable before
  using "man" program.

* "but imap-send" can optionally talk SSL.

* "but index-pack" is more careful against disk corruption while
  completing a thin pack.

* "but log --check" and "but log --exit-code" passes their underlying diff
  status with their exit status code.

* "but log" learned --simplify-merges, a milder variant of --full-history;
  "butk --simplify-merges" is easier to view than with --full-history.

* "but log" learned "--source" to show what ref each cummit was reached
  from.

* "but log" also learned "--simplify-by-decoration" to show the
  birds-eye-view of the topology of the history.

* "but log --pretty=format:" learned "%d" format element that inserts
  names of tags that point at the cummit.

* "but merge --squash" and "but merge --no-ff" into an unborn branch are
  noticed as user errors.

* "but merge -s $strategy" can use a custom built strategy if you have a
  command "but-merge-$strategy" on your $PATH.

* "but pull" (and "but fetch") can be told to operate "-v"erbosely or
  "-q"uietly.

* "but push" can be told to reject deletion of refs with receive.denyDeletes
  configuration.

* "but rebase" honours pre-rebase hook; use --no-verify to bypass it.

* "but rebase -p" uses interactive rebase machinery now to preserve the merges.

* "but reflog expire branch" can be used in place of "but reflog expire
  refs/heads/branch".

* "but remote show $remote" lists remote branches one-per-line now.

* "but send-email" can be given revision range instead of files and
  maildirs on the command line, and automatically runs format-patch to
  generate patches for the given revision range.

* "but submodule foreach" subcommand allows you to iterate over checked
  out submodules.

* "but submodule sync" subcommands allows you to update the origin URL
  recorded in submodule directories from the toplevel .butmodules file.

* "but svn branch" can create new branches on the other end.

* "butweb" can use more saner PATH_INFO based URL.

(internal)

* "but hash-object" learned to lie about the path being hashed, so that
  correct butattributes processing can be done while hashing contents
  stored in a temporary file.

* various callers of but-merge-recursive avoid forking it as an external
  process.

* Git class defined in "Git.pm" can be subclasses a bit more easily.

* We used to link GNU regex library as a compatibility layer for some
  platforms, but it turns out it is not necessary on most of them.

* Some path handling routines used fixed number of buffers used alternately
  but depending on the call depth, this arrangement led to hard to track
  bugs.  This issue is being addressed.


Fixes since v1.6.0
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.6.0.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

* Porcelains implemented as shell scripts were utterly confused when you
  entered to a subdirectory of a work tree from sideways, following a
  symbolic link (this may need to be backported to older releases later).

* Tracking symbolic links would work better on filesystems whose lstat()
  returns incorrect st_size value for them.

* "but add" and "but update-index" incorrectly allowed adding S/F when S
  is a tracked symlink that points at a directory D that has a path F in
  it (we still need to fix a similar nonsense when S is a submodule and F
  is a path in it).

* "but am" after stopping at a broken patch lost --whitespace, -C, -p and
  --3way options given from the command line initially.

* "but diff --stdin" used to take two trees on a line and compared them,
  but we dropped support for such a use case long time ago.  This has
  been resurrected.

* "but filter-branch" failed to rewrite a tag name with slashes in it.

* "but http-push" did not understand URI scheme other than opaquelocktoken
  when acquiring a lock from the server (this may need to be backported to
  older releases later).

* After "but rebase -p" stopped with conflicts while replaying a merge,
 "but rebase --continue" did not work (may need to be backported to older
  releases).

* "but revert" records relative to which parent a revert was made when
  reverting a merge.  Together with new documentation that explains issues
  around reverting a merge and merging from the updated branch later, this
  hopefully will reduce user confusion (this may need to be backported to
  older releases later).

* "but rm --cached" used to allow an empty blob that was added earlier to
  be removed without --force, even when the file in the work tree has
  since been modified.

* "but push --tags --all $there" failed with generic usage message without
  telling saying these two options are incompatible.

* "but log --author/--cummitter" match used to potentially match the
  timestamp part, exposing internal implementation detail.  Also these did
  not work with --fixed-strings match at all.

* "butweb" did not mark non-ASCII characters imported from external HTML fragments
  correctly.
