GIT v1.6.2.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.2.1
--------------------

* A longstanding confusing description of what --pickaxe option of
  but-diff does has been clarified in the documentation.

* "but-blame -S" did not quite work near the cummits that were given
  on the command line correctly.

* "but diff --pickaxe-regexp" did not count overlapping matches
  correctly.

* "but diff" did not feed files in work-tree representation to external
  diff and textconv.

* "but-fetch" in a repository that was not cloned from anywhere said
  it cannot find 'origin', which was hard to understand for new people.

* "but-format-patch --numbered-files --stdout" did not have to die of
  incompatible options; it now simply ignores --numbered-files as no files
  are produced anyway.

* "but-ls-files --deleted" did not work well with GIT_DIR&GIT_WORK_TREE.

* "but-read-tree A B C..." without -m option has been broken for a long
  time.

* but-send-email ignored --in-reply-to when --no-thread was given.

* 'but-submodule add' did not tolerate extra slashes and ./ in the path it
  accepted from the command line; it now is more lenient.

* but-svn misbehaved when the project contained a path that began with
  two dashes.

* import-zips script (in contrib) did not compute the common directory
  prefix correctly.

* miscompilation of negated enum constants by old gcc (2.9) affected the
  codepaths to spawn subprocesses.

Many small documentation updates are included as well.
