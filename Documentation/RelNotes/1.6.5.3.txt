Git v1.6.5.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.5.2
--------------------

 * info/grafts file didn't ignore trailing CR at the end of lines.

 * Packages generated on newer FC were unreadable by older versions of
   RPM as the new default is to use stronger hash.

 * output from "but blame" was unreadable when the file ended in an
   incomplete line.

 * "but add -i/-p" didn't handle deletion of empty files correctly.

 * "but clone" takes up to two parameters, but did not complain when
   given more arguments than necessary and silently ignored them.

 * "but cvsimport" did not read files given as command line arguments
   correctly when it is run from a subdirectory.

 * "but diff --color-words -U0" didn't work correctly.

 * The handling of blank lines at the end of file by "but diff/apply
   --whitespace" was inconsistent with the other kinds of errors.
   They are now colored, warned against, and fixed the same way as others.

 * There was no way to allow blank lines at the end of file without
   allowing extra blanks at the end of lines.  You can use blank-at-eof
   and blank-at-eol whitespace error class to specify them separately.
   The old trailing-space error class is now a short-hand to set both.

 * "-p" option to "but format-patch" was supposed to suppress diffstat
   generation, but it was broken since 1.6.1.

 * "but imap-send" did not compile cleanly with newer OpenSSL.

 * "but help -a" outside of a but repository was broken.

 * "but ls-files -i" was supposed to be inverse of "but ls-files" without -i
   with respect to exclude patterns, but it was broken since 1.6.5.2.

 * "but ls-remote" outside of a but repository over http was broken.

 * "but rebase -i" gave bogus error message when the command word was
   misspelled.

 * "but receive-pack" that is run in response to "but push" did not run
   garbage collection nor update-server-info, but in larger hosting sites,
   these almost always need to be run.  To help site administrators, the
   command now runs "gc --auto" and "u-s-i" by setting receive.autogc
   and receive.updateserverinfo configuration variables, respectively.

 * Release notes spelled the package name with incorrect capitalization.

 * "butweb" did not escape non-ascii characters correctly in the URL.

 * "butweb" showed "patch" link even for merge cummits.

 * "butweb" showed incorrect links for blob line numbers in pathinfo mode.

Other minor documentation updates are included.
