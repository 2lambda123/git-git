Git v1.6.5.8 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.5.7
--------------------

* "but count-objects" did not handle packfiles that are bigger than 4G on
  platforms with 32-bit off_t.

* "but rebase -i" did not abort cleanly if it failed to launch the editor.

* "but blame" did not work well when cummit lacked the author name.

* "but fast-import" choked when handling a tag that points at an object
  that is not a cummit.

* "but reset --hard" did not work correctly when GIT_WORK_TREE environment
  variable is used to point at the root of the true work tree.

* "but grep" fed a buffer that is not NUL-terminated to underlying
  regexec().

* "but checkout -m other" while on a branch that does not have any cummit
  segfaulted, instead of failing.

* "but branch -a other" should have diagnosed the command as an error.

Other minor documentation updates are also included.
