Git v1.6.6.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.6
------------------

 * "but blame" did not work well when cummit lacked the author name.

 * "but branch -a name" wasn't diagnosed as an error.

 * "but count-objects" did not handle packfiles that are bigger than 4G on
   platforms with 32-bit off_t.

 * "but checkout -m other" while on a branch that does not have any cummit
   segfaulted, instead of failing.

 * "but fast-import" choked when fed a tag that do not point at a
   cummit.

 * "but grep" finding from work tree files could have fed garbage to
   the underlying regexec(3).

 * "but grep -L" didn't show empty files (they should never match, and
   they should always appear in -L output as unmatching).

 * "but rebase -i" did not abort cleanly if it failed to launch the editor.

 * "but reset --hard" did not work correctly when BUT_WORK_TREE environment
   variable is used to point at the root of the true work tree.

 * http-backend was not listed in the command list in the documentation.

 * Building on FreeBSD (both 7 and 8) needs OLD_ICONV set in the Makefile

 * "but checkout -m some-branch" while on an unborn branch crashed.

Other minor documentation updates are included.
