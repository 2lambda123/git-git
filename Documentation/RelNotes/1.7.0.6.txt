Git v1.7.0.6 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.0.5
--------------------

 * "but diff --stat" used "int" to count the size of differences,
   which could result in overflowing.

 * "but rev-list --abbrev-cummit" defaulted to 40-byte abbreviations, unlike
   newer tools in the but toolset.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
