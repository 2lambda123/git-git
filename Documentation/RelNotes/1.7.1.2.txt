Git v1.7.1.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.1.1
--------------------

 * "but cummit" did not honor GIT_REFLOG_ACTION environment variable, resulting
   reflog messages for cherry-pick and revert actions to be recorded as "cummit".

 * "but clone/fetch/pull" issued an incorrect error message when a ref and
   a symref that points to the ref were updated at the same time.  This
   obviously would update them to the same value, and should not result in
   an error condition.

 * "but diff" inside a tree with many pathnames that have certain
   characters has become very slow in 1.7.0 by mistake.

 * "but rev-parse --parseopt --stop-at-non-option" did not stop at non option
   when --keep-dashdash was in effect.

 * An overlong line after ".butdir: " in a but file caused out of bounds
   access to an array on the stack.

 * "but config --path conf.var" to attempt to expand a variable conf.var
   that uses "~/" short-hand segfaulted when $HOME environment variable
   was not set.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
