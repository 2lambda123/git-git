Git v1.7.11.4 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.11.3
---------------------

 * "$BUT_DIR/CUMMIT_EDITMSG" file that is used to hold the cummit log
   message user edits was not documented.

 * The advise() function did not use varargs correctly to format
   its message.

 * When "but am" failed, old timers knew to check .but/rebase-apply/patch
   to see what went wrong, but we never told the users about it.

 * "but cummit-tree" learned a more natural "-p <parent> <tree>" order
   of arguments long time ago, but recently forgot it by mistake.

 * "but diff --no-ext-diff" did not output anything for a typechange
   filepair when BUT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is in effect.

 * In 1.7.9 era, we taught "but rebase" about the raw timestamp format
   but we did not teach the same trick to "filter-branch", which rolled
   a similar logic on its own.

 * When "but submodule add" clones a submodule repository, it can get
   confused where to store the resulting submodule repository in the
   superproject's .but/ directory when there is a symbolic link in the
   path to the current directory.

Also contains minor typofixes and documentation updates.
