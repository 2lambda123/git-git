Git 1.7.12.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.12.2
---------------------

 * "but am" mishandled a patch attached as application/octet-stream
   (e.g. not text/*); Content-Transfer-Encoding (e.g. base64) was not
   honored correctly.

 * It was unclear in the documentation for "but blame" that it is
   unnecessary for users to use the "--follow" option.

 * A repository created with "but clone --single" had its fetch
   refspecs set up just like a clone without "--single", leading the
   subsequent "but fetch" to slurp all the other branches, defeating
   the whole point of specifying "only this branch".

 * "but fetch" over http had an old workaround for an unlikely server
   misconfiguration; it turns out that this hurts debuggability of the
   configuration in general, and has been reverted.

 * "but fetch" over http advertised that it supports "deflate", which
   is much less common, and did not advertise the more common "gzip" on
   its Accept-Encoding header.

 * "but receive-pack" (the counterpart to "but push") did not give
   progress output while processing objects it received to the user
   when run over the smart-http protocol.

 * "but status" honored the ignore=dirty settings in .butmodules but
   "but cummit" didn't.

Also contains a handful of documentation updates.
