Git v1.7.3 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.7.2
--------------------

 * but-gui, now at version 0.13.0, got various updates and a new
   maintainer, Pat Thoyts.

 * Gitweb allows its configuration to change per each request; it used to
   read the configuration once upon startup.

 * When but finds a corrupt object, it now reports the file that contains
   it.

 * "but checkout -B <it>" is a shorter way to say "but branch -f <it>"
   followed by "but checkout <it>".

 * When "but checkout" or "but merge" refuse to proceed in order to
   protect local modification to your working tree, they used to stop
   after showing just one path that might be lost.  They now show all,
   in a format that is easier to read.

 * "but clean" learned "-e" ("--exclude") option.

 * Hunk headers produced for C# files by "but diff" and friends show more
   relevant context than before.

 * diff.ignoresubmodules configuration variable can be used to squelch the
   differences in submodules reported when running commands (e.g. "diff",
   "status", etc.) at the superproject level.

 * http.useragent configuration can be used to lie who you are to your
   restrictive firewall.

 * "but rebase --strategy <s>" learned "-X" option to pass extra options
   that are understood by the chosen merge strategy.

 * "but rebase -i" learned "exec" that you can insert into the insn sheet
   to run a command between its steps.

 * "but rebase" between branches that have many binary changes that do
   not conflict should be faster.

 * "but rebase -i" peeks into rebase.autosquash configuration and acts as
   if you gave --autosquash from the command line.


Also contains various documentation updates.


Fixes since v1.7.2
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.7.2.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

 * "but merge -s recursive" (which is the default) did not handle cases
   where a directory becomes a file (or vice versa) very well.

 * "but fetch" and friends were accidentally broken for url with "+" in
   its path, e.g. "but://but.gnome.org/gtk+".

 * "but fetch $url" (i.e. without refspecs) was broken for quite some
   time, if the current branch happen to be tracking some remote.

 * "but ls-tree dir dirgarbage", when "dir" was a directory,
   incorrectly recursed into "dir".

 * "but note remove" created unnecessary extra cummit when named object
   did not have any note to begin with.

 * "but rebase" did not work well if you had diff.noprefix configured.

 * "but -c foo=bar subcmd" did not work well for subcmd that is not
   implemented as a built-in command.
