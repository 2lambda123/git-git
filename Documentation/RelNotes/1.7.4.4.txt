Git v1.7.4.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.4.3
--------------------

 * Compilation of sha1_file.c on BSD platforms were broken due to our
   recent use of getrlimit() without including <sys/resource.h>.

 * "but config" did not diagnose incorrect configuration variable names.

 * "but format-patch" did not wrap a long subject line that resulted from
   rfc2047 encoding.

 * "but instaweb" should work better again with plackup.

 * "but log --max-count=4 -Sfoobar" now shows 4 cummits that changes the
   number of occurrences of string "foobar"; it used to scan only for 4
   cummits and then emitted only matching ones.

 * "but log --first-parent --boundary $c^..$c" segfaulted on a merge.

 * "but pull" into an empty branch should have behaved as if
   fast-forwarding from emptiness to the version being pulled, with
   the usual protection against overwriting untracked files.

 * "but submodule" that is run while a merge in the superproject is in
   conflicted state tried to process each conflicted submodule up to
   three times.

 * "but status" spent all the effort to notice racily-clean index entries
   but didn't update the index file to help later operations go faster in
   some cases.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
