Git v1.7.6.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.6.3
--------------------

 * The error reporting logic of "but am" when the command is fed a file
   whose mail-storage format is unknown was fixed.

 * "but branch --set-upstream @{-1} foo" did not expand @{-1} correctly.

 * "but check-ref-format --print" used to parrot a candidate string that
   began with a slash (e.g. /refs/heads/master) without stripping it, to make
   the result a suitably normalized string the caller can append to "$GIT_DIR/".

 * "but clone" failed to clone locally from a ".but" file that itself
   is not a directory but is a pointer to one.

 * "but clone" from a local repository that borrows from another
   object store using a relative path in its objects/info/alternates
   file did not adjust the alternates in the resulting repository.

 * "but describe --dirty" did not refresh the index before checking the
   state of the working tree files.

 * "but ls-files ../$path" that is run from a subdirectory reported errors
   incorrectly when there is no such path that matches the given pathspec.

 * "but mergetool" could loop forever prompting when nothing can be read
   from the standard input.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
