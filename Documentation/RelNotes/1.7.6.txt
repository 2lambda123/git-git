Git v1.7.6 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.7.5
--------------------

 * Various but-svn updates.

 * Updates the way content tags are handled in butweb.  Also adds
   a UI to choose common timezone for displaying the dates.

 * Similar to branch names, tagnames that begin with "-" are now
   disallowed.

 * Clean-up of the C part of i18n (but not l10n---please wait)
   continues.

 * The scripting part of the codebase is getting prepared for i18n/l10n.

 * Pushing and pulling from a repository with large number of refs that
   point to identical cummits are optimized by not listing the same cummit
   during the common ancestor negotiation exchange with the other side.

 * Adding a file larger than core.bigfilethreshold (defaults to 1/2 Gig)
   using "but add" will send the contents straight to a packfile without
   having to hold it and its compressed representation both at the same
   time in memory.

 * Processes spawned by "[alias] <name> = !process" in the configuration
   can inspect GIT_PREFIX environment variable to learn where in the
   working tree the original command was invoked.

 * A magic pathspec ":/" tells a command that limits its operation to
   the current directory when ran from a subdirectory to work on the
   entire working tree. In general, ":/path/to/file" would be relative
   to the root of the working tree hierarchy.

   After "but reset --hard; edit Makefile; cd t/", "but add -u" would
   be a no-op, but "but add -u :/" would add the updated contents of
   the Makefile at the top level. If you want to name a path in the
   current subdirectory whose unusual name begins with ":/", you can
   name it by "./:/that/path" or by "\:/that/path".

 * "but blame" learned "--abbrev[=<n>]" option to control the minimum
   number of hexdibuts shown for cummit object names.

 * "but blame" learned "--line-porcelain" that is less efficient but is
   easier to parse.

 * Aborting "but cummit --interactive" discards updates to the index
   made during the interactive session.

 * "but cummit" learned a "--patch" option to directly jump to the
   per-hunk selection UI of the interactive mode.

 * "but diff" and its family of commands learned --dirstat=0 to show
   directories that contribute less than 0.1% of changes.

 * "but diff" and its family of commands learned --dirstat=lines mode to
   assess damage to the directory based on number of lines in the patch
   output, not based on the similarity numbers.

 * "but format-patch" learned "--quiet" option to suppress the output of
   the names of generated files.

 * "but format-patch" quotes people's names when it has RFC822 special
   characters in it, e.g. "Junio C. Hamano" <jch@example.com>.  Earlier
   it was up to the user to do this when using its output.

 * "but format-patch" can take an empty --subject-prefix now.

 * "but grep" learned the "-P" option to take pcre regular expressions.

 * "but log" and friends learned a new "--notes" option to replace the
   "--show-notes" option.  Unlike "--show-notes", "--notes=<ref>" does
   not imply showing the default notes.

 * They also learned a log.abbrevcummit configuration variable to augment
   the --abbrev-cummit command line option.

 * "but ls-remote" learned "--exit-code" option to consider it a
   different kind of error when no remote ref to be shown.

 * "but merge" learned "-" as a short-hand for "the previous branch", just
   like the way "but checkout -" works.

 * "but merge" uses "merge.ff" configuration variable to decide to always
   create a merge cummit (i.e. --no-ff, aka merge.ff=no), refuse to create
   a merge cummit (i.e. --ff-only, aka merge.ff=only). Setting merge.ff=yes
   (or not setting it at all) restores the default behaviour of allowing
   fast-forward to happen when possible.

 * p4-import (from contrib) learned a new option --preserve-user.

 * "but read-tree -m" learned "--dry-run" option that reports if a merge
   would fail without touching the index nor the working tree.

 * "but rebase" that does not specify on top of which branch to rebase
   the current branch now uses @{upstream} of the current branch.

 * "but rebase" finished either normally or with --abort did not
   update the reflog for HEAD to record the event to come back to
   where it started from.

 * "but remote add -t only-this-branch --mirror=fetch" is now allowed. Earlier
   a fetch-mode mirror meant mirror everything, but now it only means refs are
   not renamed.

 * "but rev-list --count" used with "--cherry-mark" counts the cherry-picked
   cummits separately, producing more a useful output.

 * "but submodule update" learned "--force" option to get rid of local
   changes in submodules and replace them with the up-to-date version.

 * "but status" and friends ignore .butmodules file while the file is
   still in a conflicted state during a merge, to avoid using information
   that is not final and possibly corrupt with conflict markers.

Also contains various documentation updates and minor miscellaneous
changes.


Fixes since v1.7.5
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes in 1.7.5.X maintenance track are
included in this release.

 * "but config" used to choke with an insanely long line.
   (merge ef/maint-strbuf-init later)

 * "but diff --quiet" did not work well with --diff-filter.
   (merge jk/diff-not-so-quick later)

 * "but status -z" did not default to --porcelain output format.
   (merge bc/maint-status-z-to-use-porcelain later)
