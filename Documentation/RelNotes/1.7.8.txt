Git v1.7.8 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.7.7
--------------------

 * Some but-svn, but-gui, but-p4 (in contrib) and msysbut updates.

 * Updates to bash completion scripts.

 * The build procedure has been taught to take advantage of computed
   dependency automatically when the compiler supports it.

 * The date parser now accepts timezone designators that lack minutes
   part and also has a colon between "hh:mm".

 * The contents of the /etc/mailname file, if exists, is used as the
   default value of the hostname part of the cummitter/author e-mail.

 * "but am" learned how to read from patches generated by Hg.

 * "but archive" talking with a remote repository can report errors
   from the remote side in a more informative way.

 * "but branch" learned an explicit --list option to ask for branches
   listed, optionally with a glob matching pattern to limit its output.

 * "but check-attr" learned "--cached" option to look at .butattributes
   files from the index, not from the working tree.

 * Variants of "but cherry-pick" and "but revert" that take multiple
   cummits learned to "--continue" and "--abort".

 * "but daemon" gives more human readable error messages to clients
   using ERR packets when appropriate.

 * Errors at the network layer is logged by "but daemon".

 * "but diff" learned "--minimal" option to spend extra cycles to come
   up with a minimal patch output.

 * "but diff" learned "--function-context" option to show the whole
   function as context that was affected by a change.

 * "but difftool" can be told to skip launching the tool for a path by
   answering 'n' to its prompt.

 * "but fetch" learned to honor transfer.fsckobjects configuration to
   validate the objects that were received from the other end, just like
   "but receive-pack" (the receiving end of "but push") does.

 * "but fetch" makes sure that the set of objects it received from the
   other end actually completes the history before updating the refs.
   "but receive-pack" (the receiving end of "but push") learned to do the
   same.

 * "but fetch" learned that fetching/cloning from a regular file on the
   filesystem is not necessarily a request to unpack a bundle file; the
   file could be ".but" with "butdir: <path>" in it.

 * "but for-each-ref" learned "%(contents:subject)", "%(contents:body)"
   and "%(contents:signature)". The last one is useful for signed tags.

 * "but grep" used to incorrectly pay attention to .butignore files
   scattered in the directory it was working in even when "--no-index"
   option was used. It no longer does this. The "--exclude-standard"
   option needs to be given to explicitly activate the ignore
   mechanism.

 * "but grep" learned "--untracked" option, where given patterns are
    searched in untracked (but not ignored) files as well as tracked
    files in the working tree, so that matches in new but not yet
    added files do not get missed.

 * The recursive merge backend no longer looks for meaningless
   existing merges in submodules unless in the outermost merge.

 * "but log" and friends learned "--children" option.

 * "but ls-remote" learned to respond to "-h"(elp) requests.

 * "mediawiki" remote helper can interact with (surprise!) MediaWiki
   with "but fetch" & "but push".

 * "but merge" learned the "--edit" option to allow users to edit the
   merge cummit log message.

 * "but rebase -i" can be told to use special purpose editor suitable
   only for its insn sheet via sequence.editor configuration variable.

 * "but send-email" learned to respond to "-h"(elp) requests.

 * "but send-email" allows the value given to sendemail.aliasfile to begin
   with "~/" to refer to the $HOME directory.

 * "but send-email" forces use of Authen::SASL::Perl to work around
   issues between Authen::SASL::Cyrus and AUTH PLAIN/LOGIN.

 * "but stash" learned "--include-untracked" option to stash away
   untracked/ignored cruft from the working tree.

 * "but submodule clone" does not leak an error message to the UI
   level unnecessarily anymore.

 * "but submodule update" learned to honor "none" as the value for
   submodule.<name>.update to specify that the named submodule should
   not be checked out by default.

 * When populating a new submodule directory with "but submodule init",
   the $GIT_DIR metainformation directory for submodules is created inside
   $GIT_DIR/modules/<name>/ directory of the superproject and referenced
   via the butfile mechanism. This is to make it possible to switch
   between cummits in the superproject that has and does not have the
   submodule in the tree without re-cloning.

 * "butweb" leaked unescaped control characters from syntax hiliter
   outputs.

 * "butweb" can be told to give custom string at the end of the HTML
   HEAD element.

 * "butweb" now has its own manual pages.


Also contains other documentation updates and minor code cleanups.


Fixes since v1.7.7
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all fixes in the 1.7.7.X maintenance track are
included in this release.

 * HTTP transport did not use pushurl correctly, and also did not tell
   what host it is trying to authenticate with when asking for
   credentials.
   (merge deba493 jk/http-auth later to maint).

 * "but blame" was aborted if started from an uncummitted content and
   the path had the textconv filter in effect.
   (merge 8518088 ss/blame-textconv-fake-working-tree later to maint).

 * Adding many refs to the local repository in one go (e.g. "but fetch"
   that fetches many tags) and looking up a ref by name in a repository
   with too many refs were unnecessarily slow.
   (merge 17d68a54d jp/get-ref-dir-unsorted later to maint).

 * Report from "but cummit" on untracked files was confused under
   core.ignorecase option.
   (merge 395c7356 jk/name-hash-dirent later to maint).

 * "but merge" did not understand ":/<pattern>" as a way to name a cummit.

 " "but push" on the receiving end used to call post-receive and post-update
   hooks for attempted removal of non-existing refs.
   (merge 160b81ed ph/push-to-delete-nothing later to maint).

 * Help text for "but remote set-url" and "but remote set-branches"
   were misspelled.
   (merge c49904e fc/remote-seturl-usage-fix later to maint).
   (merge 656cdf0 jc/remote-setbranches-usage-fix later to maint).
