Git v1.8.0 Release Notes
========================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

In the next major release (not *this* one), we will change the
behavior of the "but push" command.

When "but push [$there]" does not say what to push, we have used the
traditional "matching" semantics so far (all your branches were sent
to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same name
over there).  We will use the "simple" semantics that pushes the
current branch to the branch with the same name, only when the current
branch is set to integrate with that remote branch.  There is a user
preference configuration variable "push.default" to change this, and
"but push" will warn about the upcoming change until you set this
variable in this release.

"but branch --set-upstream" is deprecated and may be removed in a
relatively distant future.  "but branch [-u|--set-upstream-to]" has
been introduced with a saner order of arguments.


Updates since v1.7.12
---------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * A credential helper for Win32 to allow access to the keychain of
   the logged-in user has been added.

 * An initial port to HP NonStop.

 * A credential helper to allow access to the Gnome keyring has been
   added.

 * When "but am" sanitizes the "Subject:" line, we strip the prefix from
   "Re: subject" and also from a less common "re: subject", but left
   the even less common "RE: subject" intact.  Now we strip that too.

 * It was tempting to say "but branch --set-upstream origin/master",
   but that tells Git to arrange the local branch "origin/master" to
   integrate with the currently checked out branch, which is highly
   unlikely what the user meant.  The option is deprecated; use the
   new "--set-upstream-to" (with a short-and-sweet "-u") option
   instead.

 * "but cherry-pick" learned the "--allow-empty-message" option to
   allow it to replay a cummit without any log message.

 * After "but cherry-pick -s" gave control back to the user asking
   help to resolve conflicts, concluding "but cummit" used to need to
   be run with "-s" if the user wants to sign it off; now the command
   leaves the sign-off line in the log template.

 * "but daemon" learned the "--access-hook" option to allow an
   external command to decline service based on the client address,
   repository path, etc.

 * "but difftool --dir-diff" learned to use symbolic links to prepare
   a temporary copy of the working tree when available.

 * "but grep" learned to use a non-standard pattern type by default if
   a configuration variable tells it to.

 * Accumulated updates to "but gui" has been merged.

 * "but log -g" learned the "--grep-reflog=<pattern>" option to limit
   its output to cummits with a reflog message that matches the given
   pattern.

 * "but merge-base" learned the "--is-ancestor A B" option to tell if A is
   an ancestor of B.  The result is indicated by its exit status code.

 * "but mergetool" now allows users to override the actual command used
   with the mergetool.$name.cmd configuration variable even for built-in
   mergetool backends.

 * "but rebase -i" learned the "--edit-todo" option to open an editor
   to edit the instruction sheet.


Foreign Interface

 * "but svn" has been updated to work with SVN 1.7.

 * "but p4" learned the "--conflicts" option to specify what to do when
   encountering a conflict during "p4 submit".


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * Git ships with a fall-back regexp implementation for platforms with
   buggy regexp library, but it was easy for people to keep using their
   platform regexp by mistake.  A new test has been added to check this.

 * The "check-docs" build target has been updated and greatly
   simplified.

 * The test suite is run under MALLOC_CHECK_ when running with a glibc
   that supports the feature.

 * The documentation in the TeXinfo format was using indented output
   for materials meant to be examples that are better typeset in
   monospace.

 * Compatibility wrapper around some mkdir(2) implementations that
   reject parameters with trailing slash has been introduced.

 * Compatibility wrapper for systems that lack usable setitimer() has
   been added.

 * The option parsing of "but checkout" had error checking, dwim and
   defaulting missing options, all mixed in the code, and issuing an
   appropriate error message with useful context was getting harder.
   The code has been reorganized to allow giving a proper diagnosis
   when the user says "but checkout -b -t foo bar" (e.g. "-t" is not a
   good name for a branch).

 * Many internal uses of a "but merge-base" equivalent were only to see
   if one cummit fast-forwards to the other, which did not need the
   full set of merge bases to be computed. They have been updated to
   use less expensive checks.

 * The heuristics to detect and silently convert latin1 to utf8 when
   we were told to use utf-8 in the log message has been transplanted
   from "mailinfo" to "cummit" and "cummit-tree".

 * Messages given by "but <subcommand> -h" from many subcommands have
   been marked for translation.


Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.12
-------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.12 in the
maintenance track are contained in this release (see release notes
to them for details).

 * The attribute system may be asked for a path that itself or its
   leading directories no longer exists in the working tree, and it is
   fine if we cannot open .butattribute file in such a case.  Failure
   to open per-directory .butattributes with error status other than
   ENOENT and ENOTDIR should be diagnosed, but it wasn't.

 * When looking for $HOME/.butconfig etc., it is OK if we cannot read
   them because they do not exist, but we did not diagnose existing
   files that we cannot read.

 * When "but am" is fed an input that has multiple "Content-type: ..."
   header, it did not grok charset= attribute correctly.

 * "but am" mishandled a patch attached as application/octet-stream
   (e.g. not text/*); Content-Transfer-Encoding (e.g. base64) was not
   honored correctly.

 * "but blame MAKEFILE" run in a history that has "Makefile" but not
   "MAKEFILE" should say "No such file MAKEFILE in HEAD", but got
   confused on a case insensitive filesystem and failed to do so.

 * Even during a conflicted merge, "but blame $path" always meant to
   blame uncummitted changes to the "working tree" version; make it
   more useful by showing cleanly merged parts as coming from the other
   branch that is being merged.

 * It was unclear in the documentation for "but blame" that it is
   unnecessary for users to use the "--follow" option.

 * Output from "but branch -v" contains "(no branch)" that could be
   localized, but the code to align it along with the names of
   branches was counting in bytes, not in display columns.

 * "but cherry-pick A C B" used to replay changes in A and then B and
   then C if these three cummits had cummitter timestamps in that
   order, which is not what the user who said "A C B" naturally
   expects.

 * A repository created with "but clone --single" had its fetch
   refspecs set up just like a clone without "--single", leading the
   subsequent "but fetch" to slurp all the other branches, defeating
   the whole point of specifying "only this branch".

 * Documentation talked about "first line of cummit log" when it meant
   the title of the cummit.  The description was clarified by defining
   how the title is decided and rewording the casual mention of "first
   line" to "title".

 * "but cvsimport" did not thoroughly cleanse tag names that it
   inferred from the names of the tags it obtained from CVS, which
   caused "but tag" to barf and stop the import in the middle.

 * Earlier we made the diffstat summary line that shows the number of
   lines added/deleted localizable, but it was found irritating having
   to see them in various languages on a list whose discussion language
   is English, and this change has been reverted.

 * "but fetch --all", when passed "--no-tags", did not honor the
   "--no-tags" option while fetching from individual remotes (the same
   issue existed with "--tags", but the combination "--all --tags" makes
   much less sense than "--all --no-tags").

 * "but fetch" over http had an old workaround for an unlikely server
   misconfiguration; it turns out that this hurts debuggability of the
   configuration in general, and has been reverted.

 * "but fetch" over http advertised that it supports "deflate", which
   is much less common, and did not advertise the more common "gzip" on
   its Accept-Encoding header.

 * "but fetch" over the dumb-http revision walker could segfault when
   curl's multi interface was used.

 * "but gc --auto" notified the user that auto-packing has triggered
    even under the "--quiet" option.

 * After "butk" showed the contents of a tag, neither "Reread
   references" nor "Reload" updated what is shown as the
   contents of it when the user overwrote the tag with "but tag -f".

 * "but log --all-match --grep=A --grep=B" ought to show cummits that
   mention both A and B, but when these three options are used with
   --author or --cummitter, it showed cummits that mention either A or
   B (or both) instead.

 * The "-Xours" backend option to "but merge -s recursive" was ignored
   for binary files.

 * "but p4", when "--use-client-spec" and "--detect-branches" are used
   together, misdetected branches.

 * "but receive-pack" (the counterpart to "but push") did not give
   progress output while processing objects it received to the user
   when run over the smart-http protocol.

 * When you misspell the command name you give to the "exec" action in
   the "but rebase -i" instruction sheet you were told that 'rebase' is not a
   but subcommand from "but rebase --continue".

 * The subcommand in "but remote" to remove a defined remote was
   "rm" and the command did not take a fully-spelled "remove".

 * The interactive prompt that "but send-email" gives was error prone. It
   asked "What e-mail address do you want to use?" with the address it
   guessed (correctly) the user would want to use in its prompt,
   tempting the user to say "y". But the response was taken as "No,
   please use 'y' as the e-mail address instead", which is most
   certainly not what the user meant.

 * "but show --format='%ci'" did not give the timestamp correctly for
   cummits created without human readable name on the "cummitter" line.

 * "but show --quiet" ought to be a synonym for "but show -s", but
   wasn't.

 * "but submodule frotz" was not diagnosed as "frotz" being an unknown
   subcommand to "but submodule"; the user instead got a complaint
   that "but submodule status" was run with an unknown path "frotz".

 * "but status" honored the ignore=dirty settings in .butmodules but
   "but cummit" didn't.

 * "butweb" did not give the correct cummitter timezone in its feed
   output due to a typo.
