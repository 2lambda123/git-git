Git v2.0.1 Release Notes
========================

 * We used to unconditionally disable the pager in the pager process
   we spawn to feed out output, but that prevented people who want to
   run "less" within "less" from doing so.

 * Tools that read diagnostic output in our standard error stream do
   not want to see terminal control sequence (e.g. erase-to-eol).
   Detect them by checking if the standard error stream is connected
   to a tty.
 * Reworded the error message given upon a failure to open an existing
   loose object file due to e.g. permission issues; it was reported as
   the object being corrupt, but that is not quite true.

 * "but log -2master" is a common typo that shows two cummits starting
   from whichever random branch that is not 'master' that happens to
   be checked out currently.

 * The "%<(10,trunc)%s" pretty format specifier in the log family of
   commands is used to truncate the string to a given length (e.g. 10
   in the example) with padding to column-align the output, but did
   not take into account that number of bytes and number of display
   columns are different.

 * The "mailmap.file" configuration option did not support the tilde
   expansion (i.e. ~user/path and ~/path).

 * The completion scripts (in contrib/) did not know about quite a few
   options that are common between "but merge" and "but pull", and a
   couple of options unique to "but merge".

 * "--ignore-space-change" option of "but apply" ignored the spaces
   at the beginning of line too aggressively, which is inconsistent
   with the option of the same name "diff" and "but diff" have.

 * "but blame" miscounted number of columns needed to show localized
   timestamps, resulting in jaggy left-side-edge of the source code
   lines in its output.

 * "but blame" assigned the blame to the copy in the working-tree if
   the repository is set to core.autocrlf=input and the file used CRLF
   line endings.

 * "but cummit --allow-empty-message -C $cummit" did not work when the
   cummit did not have any log message.

 * "but diff --find-copies-harder" sometimes pretended as if the mode
   bits have changed for paths that are marked with assume-unchanged
   bit.

 * "but format-patch" did not enforce the rule that the "--follow"
   option from the log/diff family of commands must be used with
   exactly one pathspec.

 * "but gc --auto" was recently changed to run in the background to
   give control back early to the end-user sitting in front of the
   terminal, but it forgot that housekeeping involving reflogs should
   be done without other processes competing for accesses to the refs.

 * "but grep -O" to show the lines that hit in the pager did not work
   well with case insensitive search.  We now spawn "less" with its
   "-I" option when it is used as the pager (which is the default).

 * We used to disable threaded "but index-pack" on platforms without
   thread-safe pread(); use a different workaround for such
   platforms to allow threaded "but index-pack".

 * The error reporting from "but index-pack" has been improved to
   distinguish missing objects from type errors.

 * "but mailinfo" used to read beyond the end of header string while
   parsing an incoming e-mail message to extract the patch.

 * On a case insensitive filesystem, merge-recursive incorrectly
   deleted the file that is to be renamed to a name that is the same
   except for case differences.

 * "but pack-objects" unnecessarily copied the previous contents when
   extending the hashtable, even though it will populate the table
   from scratch anyway.

 * "but rerere forget" did not work well when merge.conflictstyle
   was set to a non-default value.

 * "but remote rm" and "but remote prune" can involve removing many
   refs at once, which is not a very efficient thing to do when very
   many refs exist in the packed-refs file.

 * "but log --exclude=<glob> --all | but shortlog" worked as expected,
   but "but shortlog --exclude=<glob> --all", which is supposed to be
   identical to the above pipeline, was not accepted at the command
   line argument parser level.

 * The autostash mode of "but rebase -i" did not restore the dirty
   working tree state if the user aborted the interactive rebase by
   emptying the insn sheet.

 * "but show -s" (i.e. show log message only) used to incorrectly emit
   an extra blank line after a merge cummit.

 * "but status", even though it is a read-only operation, tries to
   update the index with refreshed lstat(2) info to optimize future
   accesses to the working tree opportunistically, but this could
   race with a "read-write" operation that modify the index while it
   is running.  Detect such a race and avoid overwriting the index.

 * "but status" (and "but cummit") behaved as if changes in a modified
   submodule are not there if submodule.*.ignore configuration is set,
   which was misleading.  The configuration is only to unclutter diff
   output during the course of development, and should not to hide
   changes in the "status" output to cause the users forget to cummit
   them.

 * The mode to run tests with HTTP server tests disabled was broken.
