Git v2.0.2 Release Notes
========================

 * Documentation for "but submodule sync" forgot to say that the subcommand
   can take the "--recursive" option.

 * Mishandling of patterns in .butignore that has trailing SPs quoted
   with backslashes (e.g. ones that end with "\ ") have been
   corrected.

 * Recent updates to "but repack" started to duplicate objects that
   are in packfiles marked with .keep flag into the new packfile by
   mistake.

 * "but clone -b brefs/tags/bar" would have mistakenly thought we were
   following a single tag, even though it was a name of the branch,
   because it incorrectly used strstr().

 * "%G" (nothing after G) is an invalid pretty format specifier, but
   the parser did not notice it as garbage.

 * Code to avoid adding the same alternate object store twice was
   subtly broken for a long time, but nobody seems to have noticed.

 * A handful of code paths had to read the cummit object more than
   once when showing header fields that are usually not parsed.  The
   internal data structure to keep track of the contents of the cummit
   object has been updated to reduce the need for this double-reading,
   and to allow the caller find the length of the object.

 * During "but rebase --merge", a conflicted patch could not be
   skipped with "--skip" if the next one also conflicted.
