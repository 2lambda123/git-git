Git v2.0.3 Release Notes
========================

 * An ancient rewrite passed a wrong pointer to a curl library
   function in a rarely used code path.

 * "filter-branch" left an empty single-parent cummit that results when
   all parents of a merge cummit gets mapped to the same cummit, even
   under "--prune-empty".

 * "log --show-signature" incorrectly decided the color to paint a
   mergetag that was and was not correctly validated.

 * "log --show-signature" did not pay attention to "--graph" option.

Also a lot of fixes to the tests and some updates to the docs are
included.
