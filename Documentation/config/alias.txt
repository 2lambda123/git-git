alias.*::
	Command aliases for the linkbut:but[1] command wrapper - e.g.
	after defining `alias.last = cat-file commit HEAD`, the invocation
	`but last` is equivalent to `but cat-file commit HEAD`. To avoid
	confusion and troubles with script usage, aliases that
	hide existing Git commands are ignored. Arguments are split by
	spaces, the usual shell quoting and escaping is supported.
	A quote pair or a backslash can be used to quote them.

Note that the first word of an alias does not necessarily have to be a
command. It can be a command-line option that will be passed into the
invocation of `but`. In particular, this is useful when used with `-c`
to pass in one-time configurations or `-p` to force pagination. For example,
`loud-rebase = -c cummit.verbose=true rebase` can be defined such that
running `but loud-rebase` would be equivalent to
`but -c cummit.verbose=true rebase`. Also, `ps = -p status` would be a
helpful alias since `but ps` would paginate the output of `but status`
where the original command does not.
+
If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point,
it will be treated as a shell command.  For example, defining
`alias.new = !butk --all --not ORIG_HEAD`, the invocation
`but new` is equivalent to running the shell command
`butk --all --not ORIG_HEAD`.  Note that shell commands will be
executed from the top-level directory of a repository, which may
not necessarily be the current directory.
`BUT_PREFIX` is set as returned by running `but rev-parse --show-prefix`
from the original current directory. See linkbut:but-rev-parse[1].
