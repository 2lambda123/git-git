am.keepcr::
	If true, but-am will call but-mailsplit for patches in mbox format
	with parameter `--keep-cr`. In this case but-mailsplit will
	not remove `\r` from lines ending with `\r\n`. Can be overridden
	by giving `--no-keep-cr` from the command line.
	See linkbut:but-am[1], linkbut:but-mailsplit[1].

am.threeWay::
	By default, `but am` will fail if the patch does not apply cleanly. When
	set to true, this setting tells `but am` to fall back on 3-way merge if
	the patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed to apply to and
	we have those blobs available locally (equivalent to giving the `--3way`
	option from the command line). Defaults to `false`.
	See linkbut:but-am[1].
