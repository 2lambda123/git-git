cummit.cleanup::
	This setting overrides the default of the `--cleanup` option in
	`git cummit`. See linkgit:git-cummit[1] for details. Changing the
	default can be useful when you always want to keep lines that begin
	with comment character `#` in your log message, in which case you
	would do `git config cummit.cleanup whitespace` (note that you will
	have to remove the help lines that begin with `#` in the cummit log
	template yourself, if you do this).

cummit.gpgSign::

	A boolean to specify whether all cummits should be GPG signed.
	Use of this option when doing operations such as rebase can
	result in a large number of cummits being signed. It may be
	convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your GPG passphrase
	several times.

cummit.status::
	A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information in the
	cummit message template when using an editor to prepare the cummit
	message.  Defaults to true.

cummit.template::
	Specify the pathname of a file to use as the template for
	new cummit messages.

cummit.verbose::
	A boolean or int to specify the level of verbose with `git cummit`.
	See linkgit:git-cummit[1].
