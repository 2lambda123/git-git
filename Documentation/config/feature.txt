	The config settings that start with `feature.` modify the defaults of
	a group of other config settings. These groups are created by the Git
	developer community as recommended defaults and are subject to change.
	In particular, new config options may be added with different defaults.

+
* `gc.writeCommitGraph=true` enables writing the commit-graph file during
garbage collection.
