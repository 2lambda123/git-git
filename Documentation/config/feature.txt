feature.*::
	The config settings that start with `feature.` modify the defaults of
	a group of other config settings. These groups are created by the Git
	developer community as recommended defaults and are subject to change.
	In particular, new config options may be added with different defaults.

feature.manyCommits::
	Enable config options that optimize for repos with many commits. This
	setting is recommended for repos with at least 100,000 commits. The
	new default values are:
+
* `core.commitGraph=true` enables reading the commit-graph file.
+
* `gc.writeCommitGraph=true` enables writing the commit-graph file during
garbage collection.

feature.manyFiles::
	Enable config options that optimize for repos with many files in the
	working directory. With many files, commands such as `git status` and
	`git checkout` may be slow and these new defaults improve performance:
+
* `index.version=4` enables path-prefix compression in the index.
+
* `core.untrackedCache=true` enables the untracked cache. This setting assumes
that mtime is working on your machine.
