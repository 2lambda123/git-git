i18n.cummitEncoding::
	Character encoding the cummit messages are stored in; Git itself
	does not care per se, but this information is necessary e.g. when
	importing cummits from emails or in the butk graphical history
	browser (and possibly at other places in the future or in other
	porcelains). See e.g. linkbut:but-mailinfo[1]. Defaults to 'utf-8'.

i18n.logOutputEncoding::
	Character encoding the cummit messages are converted to when
	running 'but log' and friends.
