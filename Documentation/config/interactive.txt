interactive.singleKey::
	In interactive commands, allow the user to provide one-letter
	input with a single key (i.e., without hitting enter).
	Currently this is used by the `--patch` mode of
	linkbut:but-add[1], linkbut:but-checkout[1],
	linkbut:but-restore[1], linkbut:but-cummit[1],
	linkbut:but-reset[1], and linkbut:but-stash[1]. Note that this
	setting is silently ignored if portable keystroke input
	is not available; requires the Perl module Term::ReadKey.

interactive.diffFilter::
	When an interactive command (such as `but add --patch`) shows
	a colorized diff, but will pipe the diff through the shell
	command defined by this configuration variable. The command may
	mark up the diff further for human consumption, provided that it
	retains a one-to-one correspondence with the lines in the
	original diff. Defaults to disabled (no filtering).
