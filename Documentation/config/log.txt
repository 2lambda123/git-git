log.abbrevcummit::
	If true, makes linkbut:but-log[1], linkbut:but-show[1], and
	linkbut:but-whatchanged[1] assume `--abbrev-cummit`. You may
	override this option with `--no-abbrev-cummit`.

log.date::
	Set the default date-time mode for the 'log' command.
	Setting a value for log.date is similar to using 'but log''s
	`--date` option.  See linkbut:but-log[1] for details.

log.decorate::
	Print out the ref names of any cummits that are shown by the log
	command. If 'short' is specified, the ref name prefixes 'refs/heads/',
	'refs/tags/' and 'refs/remotes/' will not be printed. If 'full' is
	specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed.
	If 'auto' is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal,
	the ref names are shown as if 'short' were given, otherwise no ref
	names are shown. This is the same as the `--decorate` option
	of the `but log`.

log.excludeDecoration::
	Exclude the specified patterns from the log decorations. This is
	similar to the `--decorate-refs-exclude` command-line option, but
	the config option can be overridden by the `--decorate-refs`
	option.

log.diffMerges::
	Set default diff format to be used for merge cummits. See
	`--diff-merges` in linkbut:but-log[1] for details.
	Defaults to `separate`.

log.follow::
	If `true`, `but log` will act as if the `--follow` option was used when
	a single <path> is given.  This has the same limitations as `--follow`,
	i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and does not work well
	on non-linear history.

log.graphColors::
	A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used to draw
	history lines in `but log --graph`.

log.showRoot::
	If true, the initial cummit will be shown as a big creation event.
	This is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree.
	Tools like linkbut:but-log[1] or linkbut:but-whatchanged[1], which
	normally hide the root cummit will now show it. True by default.

log.showSignature::
	If true, makes linkbut:but-log[1], linkbut:but-show[1], and
	linkbut:but-whatchanged[1] assume `--show-signature`.

log.mailmap::
	If true, makes linkbut:but-log[1], linkbut:but-show[1], and
	linkbut:but-whatchanged[1] assume `--use-mailmap`, otherwise
	assume `--no-use-mailmap`. True by default.
