promisor.quiet::
	If set to "true" assume `--quiet` when fetching additional
	objects for a partial clone.

promisor.advertise::
	If set to "true", a server will use the "promisor-remote"
	capability, see linkgit:gitprotocol-v2[5], to advertise the
	promisor remotes it is using if any. Default is "false", which
	means no promisor remote is advertised.

promisor.acceptFromServer::
	If set to "all", a client will accept all the promisor remotes
	a server might advertise using the "promisor-remote"
	capability, see linkgit:gitprotocol-v2[5]. Default is "none",
	which means no promisor remote advertised by a server will be
	accepted.
