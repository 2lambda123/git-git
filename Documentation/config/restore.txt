restore.defaultDestination::
	Valid values: "worktree", "staged" or "both". Controls the default
	behavior of `git restore` without `--worktree` or `--staged`. If
	"worktree", `git restore` without `--worktree` or `--staged` is
	equivalent to `git restore --worktree`. If "staged", `git restore`
	without `--worktree` or `--staged` is equivalent to `git restore
	--staged`. If "both", `git restore` without `--worktree` or `--staged`
	is equivalent to `git restore --worktree --staged`. Adding an option
	overrides the default, such that if the configuration variable is set to
	"staged", specifying `--worktree` will only affect the worktree, not
	both. This variable can be set to "staged" to help prevent accidentally
	losing modifications to the worktree, caused by running `git restore .`
	when `git restore --staged .` was intended. In this case, modifications
	to the index would be lost, which could also be a significant amount of
	work, so care is highly recommended.
