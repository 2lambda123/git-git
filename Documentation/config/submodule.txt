submodule.<name>.url::
	The URL for a submodule. This variable is copied from the .butmodules
	file to the but config via 'but submodule init'. The user can change
	the configured URL before obtaining the submodule via 'but submodule
	update'. If neither submodule.<name>.active or submodule.active are
	set, the presence of this variable is used as a fallback to indicate
	whether the submodule is of interest to but commands.
	See linkbut:but-submodule[1] and linkbut:butmodules[5] for details.

submodule.<name>.update::
	The method by which a submodule is updated by 'but submodule update',
	which is the only affected command, others such as
	'but checkout --recurse-submodules' are unaffected. It exists for
	historical reasons, when 'but submodule' was the only command to
	interact with submodules; settings like `submodule.active`
	and `pull.rebase` are more specific. It is populated by
	`but submodule init` from the linkbut:butmodules[5] file.
	See description of 'update' command in linkbut:but-submodule[1].

submodule.<name>.branch::
	The remote branch name for a submodule, used by `but submodule
	update --remote`.  Set this option to override the value found in
	the `.butmodules` file.  See linkbut:but-submodule[1] and
	linkbut:butmodules[5] for details.

submodule.<name>.fetchRecurseSubmodules::
	This option can be used to control recursive fetching of this
	submodule. It can be overridden by using the --[no-]recurse-submodules
	command-line option to "but fetch" and "but pull".
	This setting will override that from in the linkbut:butmodules[5]
	file.

submodule.<name>.ignore::
	Defines under what circumstances "but status" and the diff family show
	a submodule as modified. When set to "all", it will never be considered
	modified (but it will nonetheless show up in the output of status and
	cummit when it has been staged), "dirty" will ignore all changes
	to the submodules work tree and
	takes only differences between the HEAD of the submodule and the cummit
	recorded in the superproject into account. "untracked" will additionally
	let submodules with modified tracked files in their work tree show up.
	Using "none" (the default when this option is not set) also shows
	submodules that have untracked files in their work tree as changed.
	This setting overrides any setting made in .butmodules for this submodule,
	both settings can be overridden on the command line by using the
	"--ignore-submodules" option. The 'but submodule' commands are not
	affected by this setting.

submodule.<name>.active::
	Boolean value indicating if the submodule is of interest to but
	commands.  This config option takes precedence over the
	submodule.active config option. See linkbut:butsubmodules[7] for
	details.

submodule.active::
	A repeated field which contains a pathspec used to match against a
	submodule's path to determine if the submodule is of interest to but
	commands. See linkbut:butsubmodules[7] for details.

submodule.recurse::
	A boolean indicating if commands should enable the `--recurse-submodules`
	option by default. Defaults to false.
+
When set to true, it can be deactivated via the
`--no-recurse-submodules` option. Note that some Git commands
lacking this option may call some of the above commands affected by
`submodule.recurse`; for instance `but remote update` will call
`but fetch` but does not have a `--no-recurse-submodules` option.
For these commands a workaround is to temporarily change the
configuration value by using `but -c submodule.recurse=0`.
+
The following list shows the commands that accept
`--recurse-submodules` and whether they are supported by this
setting.

* `checkout`, `fetch`, `grep`, `pull`, `push`, `read-tree`,
`reset`, `restore` and `switch` are always supported.
* `clone` and `ls-files` are not supported.
* `branch` is supported only if `submodule.propagateBranches` is
enabled

submodule.propagateBranches::
	[EXPERIMENTAL] A boolean that enables branching support when
	using `--recurse-submodules` or `submodule.recurse=true`.
	Enabling this will allow certain commands to accept
	`--recurse-submodules` and certain commands that already accept
	`--recurse-submodules` will now consider branches.
	Defaults to false.

submodule.fetchJobs::
	Specifies how many submodules are fetched/cloned at the same time.
	A positive integer allows up to that number of submodules fetched
	in parallel. A value of 0 will give some reasonable default.
	If unset, it defaults to 1.

submodule.alternateLocation::
	Specifies how the submodules obtain alternates when submodules are
	cloned. Possible values are `no`, `superproject`.
	By default `no` is assumed, which doesn't add references. When the
	value is set to `superproject` the submodule to be cloned computes
	its alternates location relative to the superprojects alternate.

submodule.alternateErrorStrategy::
	Specifies how to treat errors with the alternates for a submodule
	as computed via `submodule.alternateLocation`. Possible values are
	`ignore`, `info`, `die`. Default is `die`. Note that if set to `ignore`
	or `info`, and if there is an error with the computed alternate, the
	clone proceeds as if no alternate was specified.
