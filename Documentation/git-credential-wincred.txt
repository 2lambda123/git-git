=========================

NAME
----
git-credential-wincred - Credential helper that connects to Windows Credential Manager

SYNOPSIS
--------
-------------------
git config credential.helper wincred
-------------------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

!NOTE: This application is only made available on Windows platforms.
See linkgit:gitcredentials[7] for other credential helpers that will work
with your platform.

This credential helper interfaces with the Windows Credential Manager 
for secure storage of credentials that are attached to the users login.

This command stores credentials indefinitely on disk for use by future
Git programs.

You probably don't want to invoke this command directly; it is meant to
be used as a credential helper by other parts of git. See
linkgit:gitcredentials[7] or `EXAMPLES` below.

EXAMPLES
--------

The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type
your username or password. For example:

------------------------------------------
$ git config credential.helper wincred
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>

[several days later]
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
[your credentials are used automatically]
------------------------------------------

STORAGE FORMAT
--------------

Credentials are stored in the Credential Manager under 
Windows Gredentials as a Generic Credential.

The credential name as stored in the Credential Manager appears like this.

------------------------------
git:https://<user>@example.com
------------------------------
