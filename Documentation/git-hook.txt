SYNOPSIS

[verse]
'but hook' run [--ignore-missing] <hook-name> [-- <hook-args>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A command interface to running but hooks (see linkbut:buthooks[5]),
for use by other scripted but commands.

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

run::
	Run the `<hook-name>` hook. See linkbut:buthooks[5] for
	supported hook names.
+

Any positional arguments to the hook should be passed after a
mandatory `--` (or `--end-of-options`, see linkbut:butcli[7]). See
linkbut:buthooks[5] for arguments hooks might expect (if any).

OPTIONS
-------

--ignore-missing::
	Ignore any missing hook by quietly returning zero. Used for
	tools that want to do a blind one-shot run of a hook that may
	or may not be present.
