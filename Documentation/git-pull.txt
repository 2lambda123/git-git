NAME
----
but-pull - Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'but pull' [<options>] [<repository> [<refspec>...]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.
If the current branch is behind the remote, then by default it will
fast-forward the current branch to match the remote.  If the current
branch and the remote have diverged, the user needs to specify how to
reconcile the divergent branches with `--rebase` or `--no-rebase` (or
the corresponding configuration option in `pull.rebase`).

More precisely, `but pull` runs `but fetch` with the given parameters
and then depending on configuration options or command line flags,
will call either `but rebase` or `but merge` to reconcile diverging
branches.

<repository> should be the name of a remote repository as
passed to linkbut:but-fetch[1].  <refspec> can name an
arbitrary remote ref (for example, the name of a tag) or even
a collection of refs with corresponding remote-tracking branches
(e.g., refs/heads/{asterisk}:refs/remotes/origin/{asterisk}),
but usually it is the name of a branch in the remote repository.

Default values for <repository> and <branch> are read from the
"remote" and "merge" configuration for the current branch
as set by linkbut:but-branch[1] `--track`.

Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
"`master`":

------------
	  A---B---C master on origin
	 /
    D---E---F---G master
	^
	origin/master in your repository
------------

Then "`but pull`" will fetch and replay the changes from the remote
`master` branch since it diverged from the local `master` (i.e., `E`)
until its current cummit (`C`) on top of `master` and record the
result in a new cummit along with the names of the two parent cummits
and a log message from the user describing the changes.

------------
	  A---B---C origin/master
	 /         \
    D---E---F---G---H master
------------

See linkbut:but-merge[1] for details, including how conflicts
are presented and handled.

In Git 1.7.0 or later, to cancel a conflicting merge, use
`but reset --merge`.  *Warning*: In older versions of Git, running 'but pull'
with uncummitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it leaves you
in a state that may be hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

If any of the remote changes overlap with local uncummitted changes,
the merge will be automatically canceled and the work tree untouched.
It is generally best to get any local changes in working order before
pulling or stash them away with linkbut:but-stash[1].

OPTIONS
-------

-q::
--quiet::
	This is passed to both underlying but-fetch to squelch reporting of
	during transfer, and underlying but-merge to squelch output during
	merging.

-v::
--verbose::
	Pass --verbose to but-fetch and but-merge.

--[no-]recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]::
	This option controls if new cummits of populated submodules should
	be fetched, and if the working trees of active submodules should be
	updated, too (see linkbut:but-fetch[1], linkbut:but-config[1] and
	linkbut:butmodules[5]).
+
If the checkout is done via rebase, local submodule cummits are rebased as well.
+
If the update is done via merge, the submodule conflicts are resolved and checked out.

Options related to merging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:but-pull: 1

-r::
--rebase[=false|true|merges|interactive]::
	When true, rebase the current branch on top of the upstream
	branch after fetching. If there is a remote-tracking branch
	corresponding to the upstream branch and the upstream branch
	was rebased since last fetched, the rebase uses that information
	to avoid rebasing non-local changes.
+
When set to `merges`, rebase using `but rebase --rebase-merges` so that
the local merge cummits are included in the rebase (see
linkbut:but-rebase[1] for details).
+
When false, merge the upstream branch into the current branch.
+
When `interactive`, enable the interactive mode of rebase.
+
See `pull.rebase`, `branch.<name>.rebase` and `branch.autoSetupRebase` in
linkbut:but-config[1] if you want to make `but pull` always use
`--rebase` instead of merging.
+
[NOTE]
This is a potentially _dangerous_ mode of operation.
It rewrites history, which does not bode well when you
published that history already.  Do *not* use this option
unless you have read linkbut:but-rebase[1] carefully.

--no-rebase::
	This is shorthand for --rebase=false.

DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR
-----------------

Often people use `but pull` without giving any parameter.
Traditionally, this has been equivalent to saying `but pull
origin`.  However, when configuration `branch.<name>.remote` is
present while on branch `<name>`, that value is used instead of
`origin`.

In order to determine what URL to use to fetch from, the value
of the configuration `remote.<origin>.url` is consulted
and if there is not any such variable, the value on the `URL:` line
in `$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>` is used.

In order to determine what remote branches to fetch (and
optionally store in the remote-tracking branches) when the command is
run without any refspec parameters on the command line, values
of the configuration variable `remote.<origin>.fetch` are
consulted, and if there aren't any, `$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>`
is consulted and its `Pull:` lines are used.
In addition to the refspec formats described in the OPTIONS
section, you can have a globbing refspec that looks like this:

------------
refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
------------

A globbing refspec must have a non-empty RHS (i.e. must store
what were fetched in remote-tracking branches), and its LHS and RHS
must end with `/*`.  The above specifies that all remote
branches are tracked using remote-tracking branches in
`refs/remotes/origin/` hierarchy under the same name.

The rule to determine which remote branch to merge after
fetching is a bit involved, in order not to break backward
compatibility.

If explicit refspecs were given on the command
line of `but pull`, they are all merged.

When no refspec was given on the command line, then `but pull`
uses the refspec from the configuration or
`$GIT_DIR/remotes/<origin>`.  In such cases, the following
rules apply:

. If `branch.<name>.merge` configuration for the current
  branch `<name>` exists, that is the name of the branch at the
  remote site that is merged.

. If the refspec is a globbing one, nothing is merged.

. Otherwise the remote branch of the first refspec is merged.


EXAMPLES
--------

* Update the remote-tracking branches for the repository
  you cloned from, then merge one of them into your
  current branch:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ but pull
$ but pull origin
------------------------------------------------
+
Normally the branch merged in is the HEAD of the remote repository,
but the choice is determined by the branch.<name>.remote and
branch.<name>.merge options; see linkbut:but-config[1] for details.

* Merge into the current branch the remote branch `next`:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ but pull origin next
------------------------------------------------
+
This leaves a copy of `next` temporarily in FETCH_HEAD, and
updates the remote-tracking branch `origin/next`.
The same can be done by invoking fetch and merge:
+
------------------------------------------------
$ but fetch origin
$ but merge origin/next
------------------------------------------------


If you tried a pull which resulted in complex conflicts and
would want to start over, you can recover with 'but reset'.

BUGS
----
Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new cummits in already checked
out submodules right now. When e.g. upstream added a new submodule in the
just fetched cummits of the superproject the submodule itself cannot be
fetched, making it impossible to check out that submodule later without
having to do a fetch again. This is expected to be fixed in a future Git
version.
