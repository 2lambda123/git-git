NAME
----
butrevisions - Specifying revisions and ranges for Git

SYNOPSIS
--------
butrevisions


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Many Git commands take revision parameters as arguments. Depending on
the command, they denote a specific cummit or, for commands which
walk the revision graph (such as linkbut:but-log[1]), all cummits which are
reachable from that cummit. For commands that walk the revision graph one can
also specify a range of revisions explicitly.

In addition, some Git commands (such as linkbut:but-show[1] and
linkbut:but-push[1]) can also take revision parameters which denote
other objects than cummits, e.g. blobs ("files") or trees
("directories of files").
