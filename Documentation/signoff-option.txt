--signoff::
--no-signoff::
	Add a `Signed-off-by` trailer by the cummitter at the end of the cummit
	log message.  The meaning of a signoff depends on the project
	to which you're cummitting.  For example, it may certify that
	the cummitter has the rights to submit the work under the
	project's license or agrees to some contributor representation,
	such as a Developer Certificate of Origin.
	(See http://developercertificate.org for the one used by the
	Linux kernel and Git projects.)  Consult the documentation or
	leadership of the project to which you're contributing to
	understand how the signoffs are used in that project.

The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier --signoff
option on the command line.
