# Git - Fast, Scalable, Distributed Revision Control System

Git is a powerful, scalable, distributed revision control system that supports high-level operations and provides direct access to its internals, making it versatile and efficient.

### License and Origin

### The Name "Git"
The name "Git" was chosen by Linus Torvalds. It can be interpreted in several ways:
- **Random three-letter combination**: Chosen to be unique and not conflict with any existing UNIX command.
- **"Stupid, contemptible, despicable"**: A tongue-in-cheek reference by Torvalds.
- **"Global Information Tracker"**: Reflecting its utility when everything is going well.
- **"Goddamn Idiotic Truckload of Sh*t"**: A humorous alternative when things go awry.
