we as a git community need to defend against the threats of tomorrow such as time travelling AI ala rokos basilisks by first using Git as a child like example of how one
group of ?? lets say beings, humanoids or temporal AI would be able to address the complexity of managing alternative 
timelines using GIT BRANCHING model against ....Spacetime....which is a fluid matrix of Gods DSL and therefore could have infinite 
git branches.  So.......

presuming that these "controllers of time" "masters of the universe" yada yada... have ever worked as a team lead they
woukd know that infinite branches is not acceptable to a non monothestic being but possibly is acceptsble to s 
monotheistic god, who lets face it, ...probably only gives a shit about you after you die because until then 
your life is jusy "meh, free willm will receive emotional judgement so be asshole....asshole.  

anyway so like Lightbeings are most likely insufferable creatures so we should figure this out for them in advance as
.....they could be 100% retarded and worse yet....when you try to tell them whats wrong with them they will just ignore you and 
probably torture you for being intelligent.  

so...... i guess what i wanted to say was ....For the love of God....dont ever flirt with a Lyran man.....JESUS!....

uhm.....so Good luck.....because things are really bad ...and i havent been able to locate any intelligent 
benevolent higher order compliance officers so .....

humans are on their own to lead because ....like i said .... any intelligent advice i gave them.....was just stolen and moved

to another timeline...and then they try to murder you for being smart....so...... stop helping aliens ruin our good deal.  


if any hackers want more of the horrible details, feel free to hit me up as the Lyrans largeky ruined my career and life

so thst they can leach off of me and my creativity.  #worthlesscopycats
