(error "but.el no longer ships with but. It's recommended to
replace its use with Mabut, or simply delete references to but.el
in your initialization file(s). See contrib/emacs/README in but's
sources (https://buthub.com/but/but/blob/master/contrib/emacs/README)
for suggested alternatives and for why this happened. Emacs's own
VC mode and Mabut are viable alternatives.")
