The but-p4 script moved to the top-level of the but source directory.

Invoke it as any other but command, like "but p4 clone", for instance.

Note that the top-level but-p4.py script is now the source.  It is
built using make to but-p4, which will be installed.

Windows users can copy the but-p4.py source script directly, possibly
invoking it through a batch file called "but-p4.bat" in the same folder.
It should contain just one line:

    @python "%~d0%~p0but-p4.py" %*
