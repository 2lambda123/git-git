This topic branch re-adds the deprecated --stdin/-z options to `git
reset`. Those patches were overridden by a different set of options in
the upstream Git project before we could propose `--stdin`.

We offered this in MinGit to applications that wanted a safer way to
pass lots of pathspecs to Git, and these applications will need to be
adjusted.

Instead of `--stdin`, `--pathspec-from-file=-` should be used, and
instead of `-z`, `--pathspec-file-nul`.
