GIT web Interface
=================

From the but version 1.4.0 butweb is bundled with but.


Build time butweb configuration
-------------------------------
There are many configuration variables which affect building butweb (among
others creating butweb.cgi out of butweb.perl by replacing placeholders such
as `++GIT_BINDIR++` by their build-time values).

Building and installing butweb is described in butweb's INSTALL file
(in 'butweb/INSTALL').


Runtime butweb configuration
----------------------------
Gitweb obtains configuration data from the following sources in the
following order:

1. built-in values (some set during build stage),
2. common system-wide configuration file (`GITWEB_CONFIG_COMMON`,
   defaults to '/etc/butweb-common.conf'),
3. either per-instance configuration file (`GITWEB_CONFIG`, defaults to
   'butweb_config.perl' in the same directory as the installed butweb),
   or if it does not exists then system-wide configuration file
   (`GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM`, defaults to '/etc/butweb.conf').

Values obtained in later configuration files override values obtained earlier
in above sequence.

You can read defaults in system-wide GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM from GITWEB_CONFIG
by adding

  read_config_file($GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM);

at very beginning of per-instance GITWEB_CONFIG file.  In this case
settings in said per-instance file will override settings from
system-wide configuration file.  Note that read_config_file checks
itself that the $GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM file exists.

The most notable thing that is not configurable at compile time are the
optional features, stored in the '%features' variable.

Ultimate description on how to reconfigure the default features setting
in your `GITWEB_CONFIG` or per-project in `project.but/config` can be found
as comments inside 'butweb.cgi'.

See also butweb.conf(5) manpage.


Web server configuration
------------------------
Gitweb can be run as CGI script, as legacy mod_perl application (using
ModPerl::Registry), and as FastCGI script.  You can find some simple examples
in "Example web server configuration" section in INSTALL file for butweb (in
butweb/INSTALL).

See "Webserver configuration" and "Advanced web server setup" sections in
butweb(1) manpage.
