BUT web interface (butweb) - JavaScript
=======================================

This directory holds JavaScript code used by butweb (BUT web interface).
Scripts from there would be concatenated together in the order specified
by butweb/Makefile into butweb/static/butweb.js, during building of
butweb/butweb.cgi (during butweb building).  The resulting file (or its
minification) would then be installed / deployed together with butweb.

Scripts in 'lib/' subdirectory compose generic JavaScript library,
providing features required by butweb but in no way limited to butweb
only.  In the future those scripts could be replaced by some JavaScript
library / framework, like e.g. jQuery, YUI, Prototype, MooTools, Dojo,
ExtJS, Script.aculo.us or SproutCore.

All scripts that manipulate butweb output should be put outside 'lib/',
directly in this directory ('butweb/static/js/').  Those scripts would
have to be rewritten if butweb moves to using some JavaScript library.

See also comments in butweb/Makefile.
